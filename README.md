### Description

This program, WHICH MUST BE COMPILED TO WORK, will allow you to lock and unlock the ability to run executable files on your system. It also creates a icon on the desktop that cannot be deleted as well as a control panel. Also includes NukeAppLock, to remove all the registry entries it creates.

Oh yea, if you can figure out a way around this, let me know.
